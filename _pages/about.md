Hi, this is Ying Li. I'm an incoming Ph.D. Student in the ECE department at [UCLA](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), working with Prof. [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/). 

I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Sichuan University(SCU), and after that, I studied at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS). I was also a research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK). 

I am incredibly grateful for the professional help and guidance from my great advisors and collaborators, including Prof. [Kai Chen](http://kaichen.org/) at UCAS, Prof. [Xianghang Mi](https://xianghang.me/) at USTC, Prof. [Sze Yiu Chau](https://szeyiuchau.github.io/) at CUHK and Prof. [Cheng Huang](https://chenghuang.org/) at SCU.

I am broadly interested in the data-driven security, IoT security, and program analysis.
